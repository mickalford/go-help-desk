## What it is

OpsMuster is an open-source ticket management system. Staff submit and track support requests. Support teams triage, respond, and resolve them. Everything runs on your infrastructure.

- **No cloud required.** PostgreSQL + a single Go binary.
- **No SaaS lock-in.** Your data stays where you put it.
- **Deploys in one command.**

## Features

- CTI ticket classification (Category → Type → Item) with drag-to-reorder and inline rename in the admin UI
- Customizable ticket statuses — deactivate to hide from workflows, permanently delete only when empty; full status change timeline on each ticket
- Local accounts, TOTP MFA, and SAML 2.0 SSO
- Role-based access (Admin / Staff / User)
- Full user management — edit profile, role, group membership; disable/enable accounts; reset MFA and password; delete accounts
- Groups — named pools of staff; tickets can be assigned to a group and any member can act on them
- Group scoping tied to CTI categories (a group is only assigned tickets it owns)
- CTI-linked group management — assign groups directly from the CTI editor per category or type
- Custom fields — admin-defined fields (text, textarea, number, select) assigned per CTI node; values stored normalized for filterability; editable by staff after creation
- Tags — free-form labels on tickets; staff create tags on first use (stored lowercase); admins can deactivate or restore tags
- Linked tickets (related, parent/child, duplicate, caused-by)
- Live ticket search — by tracking number (prefix), subject, or description keywords; staff/admin can jump directly to a ticket by tracking number or UUID
- Email and webhook notifications
- Optional SLA tracking
- Configurable branding — site name and logo upload (PNG, SVG, JPG, GIF; auto-scaled to 320 × 64 px) via the admin UI
- REST API with API key and OAuth2 client-credential auth
- MCP server for AI assistant integration
- WASM plugin system (sandboxed)
- Guest ticket submission (optional) — name, email, and optional phone captured; tracking number returned
- File attachments (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, LOG, JPEG, PNG, BMP; 25 MB max; images auto-recompressed; optional ClamAV virus scanning)

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PubliciaLLC/go-help-desk
cd opsmuster/docker
cp .env.example .env   # set SESSION_SECRET, JWT_SECRET, BASE_URL
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. On a fresh database the app redirects to `/setup`, where you create the first admin account. The setup route is permanently disabled once any user exists.

## Configuration

Environment variables control infrastructure; feature flags (SAML, MFA, SLA, guest submission) and branding are managed through the **Admin → Settings** UI and stored in the database.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | — | `postgres://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=disable` |
| `BASE_URL` | yes | — | Public URL (e.g. `https://helpdesk.example.com`) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | yes | — | Random secret ≥ 32 chars |
| `JWT_SECRET` | yes | — | Random secret ≥ 32 chars |
| `HTTP_PORT` | | `8080` | Listen port |
| `SMTP_HOST` | | — | Enables email notifications when set |
| `SMTP_PORT` | | `587` | |
| `SMTP_USER` | | — | |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | | — | |
| `SMTP_FROM` | | — | |
| `ATTACHMENT_DIR` | | `/data/attachments` | Attachment storage path |
| `CLAMAV_ADDR` | | `tcp://clamav:3310`* | ClamAV daemon address. The Docker Compose setup runs ClamAV automatically and wires this up. For bare-metal / Kubernetes installs, set this to your own daemon address; leave it unset to disable scanning. |
| `APP_ENV` | | `production` | Set to `development` for verbose logging |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

> \* In Docker Compose, `CLAMAV_ADDR` is set automatically. The `clamav` service runs alongside the app on a private internal network. You do not need to set this variable yourself.
>
> **Note:** SAML, MFA, SLA, and guest-submission are toggled in the Admin UI — not environment variables. Environment variables that existed for these in older versions have been removed.

## API

The REST API is documented informally by the handler source at `backend/internal/server/`. Key endpoints:

| Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/site` | none | Public branding info and app version |
| `GET /api/v1/logo` | none | Serve the uploaded logo file |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/settings/logo` | admin | Upload a logo (multipart, field `logo`) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/admin/settings/logo` | admin | Remove the logo |
| `GET /api/v1/setup/status` | none | Whether first-run setup is needed |
| `POST /api/v1/setup` | none (once) | Create the first admin account |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/local/login` | none | Session login |
| `GET/POST /api/v1/tickets` | session / API key | List or create tickets |
| `GET/PATCH /api/v1/tickets/{id}` | session / API key | Get or update a ticket |
| `GET /api/v1/groups` | staff / admin | List groups (for ticket assignment) |
| `GET /api/v1/tags?q=` | any auth | Active tags (autocomplete) |
| `GET/POST /api/v1/admin/groups` | admin | Manage groups |
| `GET/POST /api/v1/admin/groups/{id}/members` | admin | Manage group membership |
| `GET /api/v1/admin/tags` | admin | All tags including deactivated |
| `DELETE /api/v1/admin/tags/{id}` | admin | Deactivate a tag |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/tags/{id}/restore` | admin | Restore a deactivated tag |
| `GET/POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/tags` | staff / admin | List or add tags on a ticket |
| `DELETE /api/v1/tickets/{id}/tags/{tagId}` | staff / admin | Remove a tag from a ticket |
| `GET /api/v1/categories` | none | Active categories (for ticket creation) |
| `GET /api/v1/categories/{id}/types` | none | Active types for a category |
| `GET/POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/attachments` | session / API key | List or upload attachments |
| `GET /api/v1/tickets/{id}/attachments/{attachId}` | session / API key | Download an attachment |

OAuth2 client credentials (`POST /api/v1/auth/oauth/token`) produce short-lived JWTs for machine-to-machine access.

## Development

Requires Go 1.24+, Node 24+, PostgreSQL 17+.

```sh
# backend
cd backend && go mod download
go run ./cmd/server

# frontend (in a separate terminal)
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/mcp` to `:8080`.

Tests:

```sh
# Unit tests (no DB required)
cd backend
go test ./internal/domain/... ./internal/config/... ./internal/middleware/... ./internal/server/notify/...

# Integration tests via Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --profile test run --rm test

# Integration tests from the host (port 5432 is exposed)
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://helpdesk:helpdesk@localhost:5432/helpdesk?sslmode=disable go test ./...
```

Schema changes: edit `queries/*.sql`, add a migration under `internal/database/migrations/`, run `sqlc generate`. Never hand-edit `internal/dbgen/`.

To override the version string at build time:

```sh
go build -ldflags "-X github.com/publiciallc/opsmuster/backend/internal/version.Version=1.0.0" ./cmd/server
```
